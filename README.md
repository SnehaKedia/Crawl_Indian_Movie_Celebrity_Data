repo_name: Crawl_Indian_Movie_Celebrity_Data

Problem Statement: 
## Crawl popular websites & create a database of Indian movie celebrities with their images and personality traits.

Language: Python (Scrapy)

In the project added, I have used SCRAPY to scrape data from IMDB and Wikipedia and store it in a csv file.
The project can be further modified to store the data in MongoDB or MySQL as well.
